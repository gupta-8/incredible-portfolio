# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability
If you find a security issue, please do **not** open a public issue.

Instead:
- Open a GitHub Security Advisory (preferred), or
- Contact the maintainer privately

## Sensitive files
- `storage/messages.csv` contains contact form messages and should never be public.
